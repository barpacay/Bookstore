# What is it?
This contains a command-line interface (CLI) program for managing the inventory and members of a bookstore.
The user selects  from options like "make a purchase", "become a member",and t"getting a discount code by completing a survey" from the main menu provided and then follows the instructions for futher steps. 

# How was it developed?
This was a solo whole semester project. The project had milestones set by the professor. The first was completing the basic  interface, second  was to add the interface objects, declare inheritance structure and abstract classes, and the final one was to incorporate the feedbacks from professor and TAs. 

# What were the concepts covered?
Object oriented programming concepts such as abstract classes, interfaces, and inheritance as well as basic programming concepts like branching and looping were covered.  

# How does it work?
The program is designed to track inventory using an ArrayList as a data structure, which is initialized to store items of a base class.
Each physical item type sold by the bookstore is then subclassed from this base class.
